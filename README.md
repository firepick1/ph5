# ph5
C++ library for Pythagorean Hodograph Quintic curves

### Overview
Pythogrean Hodograph curves provide a clean and elegant representation for
machine traversable curves without the control point clutter that plagues cubic splines.
Quintic PH curves provide C2 continuity ideal for smooth machine acceleration.

This library is targeted for use in FirePick Delta machines, but may find use
elsewhere.
